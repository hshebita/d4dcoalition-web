NDI's Gender, Women, and Democracy team worked with women in politics and women's rights organization to develop develop three case study countries on specific challenges women face as they engage in online political discourse. The countries that were analyzed for the case study were Colombia, Indonesia, and Kenya. The results of the case studies showed that women engaging in politics online experience hate speech and insults, physical threats, reputational risk, and sexualized misrepresentation. The report highlights the need to analyze this topic on a larger scale to understand and mitigate the impact of online violence. But the report also represented how women are eliminating barriers and participating in politics.
