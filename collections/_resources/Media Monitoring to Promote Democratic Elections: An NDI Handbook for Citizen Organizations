Political campaigns need to protect themselves from hacking and often don’t know where to start. The good news is that there are a few fundamentals that can dramatically reduce the likelihood and impact of cybersecurity incidents.

The Cybersecurity Campaign Playbook, produced by Harvard’s Belfer Center in partnership with D4D Coalition members NDI and IRI, presents high impact, easy to understand cybersecurity principles and practices that every campaign should put in place.
