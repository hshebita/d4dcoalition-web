Full Fact, a British fact-checking group, released a report entitled “[Tackling misinformation in an open society. How to respond to misinformation and disinformation when the cure risks being worse than the disease][link].” The report explains that it is more realistic to build resilience against disinformation and misinformation in the UK than to eliminate it all together. In the paper, Full Fact sets out a framework for response to disinformation and misinformation that is proportionate and risk-based, and caution against taking action without thinking through the consequences and allowing time for further research into the harm caused by such campaigns.
