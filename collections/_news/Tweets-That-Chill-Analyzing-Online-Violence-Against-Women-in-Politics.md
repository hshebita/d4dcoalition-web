D4D member NDI's Gender, Women, and Democracy team undertook a [unique study][link] to explore the effect of gender-based violence, as expressed toward college-age, politically-active women on Twitter in three countries - Indonesia, Colombia, and Kenya. In these three countries, NDI worked with a number of women in politics, and civic technology and women's rights organizations to examine the country-and context-specific challenges women face, as they engage in political discourse. The report finds that online violence against women in politics led to women pausing, decreasing, or completely stopping their Twitter activity. It also highlights the additional need for research to understand and mitigate the impact of violence against women in politics. NDI hopes these findings will be used to inform changes to social media platform policies and global legal and political frameworks.
