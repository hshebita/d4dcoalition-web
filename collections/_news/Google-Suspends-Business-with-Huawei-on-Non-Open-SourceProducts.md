Under political pressure from the Trump Administration, digital tech giant Google has decided to [end part of its business][link] with Chinese telecoms manufacturer Huawei. This means that future buyers of Huawei smartphones and other products will no longer be able to download Google made apps or services; Gmail, YouTube and the Chrome browser will be unavailable. However current owners of a Huawei device will still be able to receive updates on their Google software, and future users of Huawei hardware will still be able to access Google's open-source features like the Android Open-Source Project. The announcement from Google comes after Huawei has received criticism from western governments for years for allegedly stealing the information and intellectual property of its users and providing it to China and other autocratic governments.
