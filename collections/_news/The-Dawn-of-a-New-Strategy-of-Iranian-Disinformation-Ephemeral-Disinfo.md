A network of likely Iranian-linked social media bots and fake accounts has been discovered attempting to sow divisiveness and criticism of the United States, Saudi Arabia, and Israel. This new initiative, called "Endless Mayfly" by a [new report][link] from The Citizen Lab, is one of the largest attempts by Iran (or allied or proxy groups) to spread disinformation. Though similar in nature to attempts by Russian agents, this disinformation campaign was novel in that once fake accounts posted false stories and gained traction, they were quickly deleted. After these fake stories or reports had gained a significant amount of notoriety, the Endless Mayfly account operators then changed the link destination from a given false story to the legitimate website of the news organization or academic institution that the post was imitating. This strategy of "ephemeral" disinformation has the dual effect of obscuring the original source of a fake story, as well as giving the appearance that a fake story is linked to, or even created by, legitimate groups.
