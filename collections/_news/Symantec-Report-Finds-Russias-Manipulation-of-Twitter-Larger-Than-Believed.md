Research Symantec, a cybersecurity firm, concluded that Russia's infamous troll farm, the Internet Research Agency, may not only have reached more users than previously thought, but may also have generated income for some of the phony accounts, some earning as much as $1 million. [The analysis][link] also found that while most accounts were automated, many were manually manipulated in an effort to dodge detection. It also found that fake accounts targeted partisans on both ends of the political spectrum and most pretended to be regional news outlets. The Symantec report comes as they are evaluating the impact of interference attempts on the European Parliament election that took place at the end of May. Politico offers a contextual summary [here][link 2].
