"Deepfakes," fake videos or photos doctored to look real, are a form of disinformation that have seen a troubling proliferation in recent months. Used to make it look like an individual (often a politician or entertainment celebrity) saying or doing something that they haven't done in real life, they are becoming easier for anyone with the right technology to create. With new cutting-edge [facial recognition technology developed by Samsung][link], for instance, an individual could make a depfake video using a single picture of their target. In May, thousands of Americans [were misled into believing][link 2] the authenticity of "shallowfakes" or simpler modified and slowed videos of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi in which she appeared to be drunk and slurring her speech. These videos, [one of which][link 3] was tweeted by President Donald Trump, are some of a growing number of altered videos that have been created by politically motivated individuals and groups to discredit their opponents.
