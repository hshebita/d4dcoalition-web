In a new report,  the European Union's (EU) Commission and the High Representative provides [an initial assessment][link] of how the implementation of its Action Plan Against Disinformation and the Elections Package has fared. The report states that the EU strengthened its capabilities to detect, analyze, and expose disinformation; improved coordinated responses; implemented a self-regulatory code of practice on disinformation; improved societal resilience, and; has worked to protect the integrity of elections. It concludes that while there has been progress, more human and financial resources and a joint EU effort are needed to further protect our democratic processes and institutions.
